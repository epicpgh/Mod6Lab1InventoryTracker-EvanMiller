// ===== Creating a class ====

// A class is a blueprint or template that represents some type of objects in our application.
// We use Classes to generate objects.

// Here is a blueprint of a Vehicle for our racing simulation game
export default class Vehicle {
    // These are the properties and the types of every vehicle object
    brand: string;
    model: string;
    year: string;
    color: string;
    odometer: number;
    isRunning: boolean;
  
    // The constructor, is the function that initializes the new object's properties
    constructor(
      brand: string,
      model: string,
      year: string,
      color: string,
      odometer = 0
    ) {
      // The "this" keyword is the new object being initialize inside the class
      // this.object property = parameter
      this.brand = brand;
      this.model = model;
      this.year = year;
      this.color = color;
      this.odometer = odometer;
      // we can also have properties that gets initialize without needing a parameter
      this.isRunning = false;
    }
  
    // here we can create the object's functionality or methods.
    // let's create a way to start our vehicle
    start(): void {
      this.isRunning = true;
    }
  }
  
  // Now is time to create some vehicles
  
  // if we want the constructor function to run we need to use the keyword "new" in front of the class name
  const myVehicle = new Vehicle("Nissan", "GTR", "2025", "white");
  
  // lets see our vehicle:
  console.log(myVehicle);
  
  // lets turn it on:
  myVehicle.start();
  
  // lets see the state of the vehicle now that we turned it on:
  console.log(myVehicle);
  
  if (myVehicle.isRunning) {
    console.log(`${myVehicle.brand} ${myVehicle.model} takes the lead`);
    myVehicle.odometer += 5; // increase the odometer
  }
  
  // lets look at the odometer now:
  console.log(myVehicle);
